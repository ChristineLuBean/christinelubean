### Hello! I'm Christine LuBean ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer, writer, and artist living in Washington state.

My love of solving problems and learning how things work lead me to teaching myself how to create websites when I was 11. I went from a kid with a beaten up HTML manual to a full-stack developer over the course of my teenage and young adulthood years.

At the moment, Iâ€™m working as a freelance developer and a software engineer at 100Devs. Using my skills as a designer and programmer, I create beautiful and accessible websites and web apps.

When Iâ€™m not coding, drawing, or writing, Iâ€™m playing video games with my husband while being harassed by my two cats.
